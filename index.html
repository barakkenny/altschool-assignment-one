    <h3>Why Altschool:</h3>
    <p>
      I started learning how code a year before starting this journey, I specialised in thr front-end part of the web and i can say 
      i'm good at what i do. Over the years, I realised that self-learning though fantastic takes a lot of time, and this has my learning
      especially when i started JavaScript, I had no mentor or anyone to guide me, i was just learning what i feel is the best. I decided
      to register for Altschool because I wanted a more structured learning that is guidance from top engineers in the industry and so far,
      my decision was a fantastic one.
